________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This repository contains the notebooks accompanying implementations of transfer learning, continuous and discrete convolutional networks with the aim of creating a network to autonomously navigate the SunFounder PiCar around a track given obstacles and traffic transitions such as stopping at a red light and continuing at a green light. There are three notebooks, a categorical CNN, continuous CNN and transfer learning applications.
