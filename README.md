This repository contains the notebook that sees the implementation and optimization of a convolutional network. The underlying task is to prediction two
quantities; steering angle and speed of a [SunFounder PiCar](https://www.sunfounder.com/smart-video-car-kit-v2-0.html). 

**Data collection**:
The data collection was performed in segments, where each particular scenario of the final test enirvonment was targeted. The remote controlled car was manuvoured via external controls around the following tracks
